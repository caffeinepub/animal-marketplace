  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required changes for Version 55. REQ-184, REQ-185, REQ-186, REQ-187, and REQ-190 are addressed. REQ-188 and REQ-189 require verification across multiple page files, but the diff only shows partial evidence for these.",

      "requirement": "Audit all page-level components (PostAdPage.tsx, ListingDetailPage.tsx, MessagesPage.tsx, ProfilePage.tsx, UserDashboardPage.tsx, SignUpPage.tsx, and others) for full-width/full-height containers with inadvertent pointer-events that may conflict with the bottom nav z-index.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows HomePage.tsx was modified for pointer-events fixes. There is no evidence in the diff that PostAdPage.tsx, ListingDetailPage.tsx, MessagesPage.tsx, ProfilePage.tsx, UserDashboardPage.tsx, or SignUpPage.tsx were audited or modified to add pointer-events: none to decorative containers.",

      "reason": "The diff does not include any modifications to frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts or frontend/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx. While the file summary for useQueries.ts and App.tsx mentions waitForActor retry logic and CattleTrackerRouteGuard reading principal from identity, there is no direct diff evidence showing these files were verified or touched in this version.",
