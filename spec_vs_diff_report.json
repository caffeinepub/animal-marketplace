  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-120, REQ-121, REQ-122) appear to be implemented in the diff. The CattleTrackerRouteGuard in App.tsx uses loginStatus-based loading detection and synchronous principal comparison. useIsCattleTrackerUser() in useQueries.ts reads the principal directly from identity context. Layout.tsx adds the ADMIN PANEL button conditionally based on isCattleTrackerUser. The implementations match the specified requirements.",

      "reason": "REQ-122 specifies the button must be at the very top of the mobile/side menu. The diff shows it was also added to the desktop nav section in Layout.tsx, which was not requested.",
