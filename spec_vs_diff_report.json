  "summary": "Both REQ-30 and REQ-31 appear to be implemented. The diff shows HelplinePage.tsx was updated (though truncated) and Layout.tsx now includes 'tel:7829297025' and '7829297025 / 8461207976' per the frontend-file-summaries.txt description. The HelplinePage.tsx content is truncated so full verification of REQ-30 details is limited, but the file-summaries.txt does not explicitly mention the email or dual phone numbers in HelplinePage. REQ-31 is clearly implemented per the Layout.tsx summary.",
