The guard must: (1) while authentication state is still loading, render a loading spinner and NOT redirect; (2) only redirect to '/' when loading is complete AND the authenticated principal does NOT match 'rhoqt-xhqg1-66ofc-khas4-fm4w6-73h56-vt55b-5bfnp-adgps-qxwoy-iqe'; (3) use the principal string obtained directly from the Internet Identity context (e.g. identity?.getPrincipal().toText()) for comparison — do not rely on any async backend query that may not have resolved yet. Ensure the comparison trims whitespace and is an exact string match.",

This button must route to '/tracker' (the Cattle Tracker page).
