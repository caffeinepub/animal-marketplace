# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add "Sheep 🐑" as a new category option across all relevant frontend controls in the Pashu Mandi app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add "Sheep 🐑" option to the category dropdown in `PostAdPage.tsx` with value `'Sheep'`
- Add "Sheep 🐑" option to the category filter dropdown in `HomePage.tsx` so users can filter listings by Sheep
- Add `'Sheep'` to the category label map in `ListingCard.tsx` with a distinct badge color consistent with the app's Professional Blue and white theme, displaying the label "Sheep 🐑"

**User-visible outcome:** Users can post ads under the "Sheep 🐑" category, filter listings by Sheep on the home page, and see a correctly labeled and colored badge on Sheep listing cards.
